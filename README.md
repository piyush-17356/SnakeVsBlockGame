# SnakeVsBlockGame
A basic Snake vs Block Game using Java, JavaFX and GUI where the player was supposed to move the snake in order to avoid obstacles and collect game tokens like food, bomb, etc. to improve score. There was also a feature to pause and save game progress and continue from that point later on. Also top 5 scores were saved and updated whenever required.
